      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title when you register for an account.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Billing address and payment card details (processed securely by our payment provider).</li>
        <li><strong>Job Data:</strong> Information about jobs, customers, sites, equipment, and certificates you create within the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Any correspondence you send to us, including support requests and feedback.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> How you interact with our services, features used, and time spent.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, browser type, and IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate location based on IP address; precise location only with your explicit consent for field services features. The Digital Fire Logbook checks location once, at the moment someone signs an entry. It asks the phone for permission first, to show whether the entry was signed on site. It never tracks anyone, and declining never blocks an entry.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> See our <Link href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link> for details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To provide, maintain, and improve our operations management platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> To create and manage your account, process payments, and provide customer support.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send service updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> To send promotional communications (with your consent) which you can opt out of at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand how our services are used and to improve user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Features:</strong> To power Setup Copilot (workspace setup) and Insights (answering business questions about your account). See section 5.3 below for what this involves and who processes it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (UK GDPR)</h2>
      <p>We process your personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing necessary to perform our contract with you (providing our services).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Processing necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as improving our services and preventing fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where you have given explicit consent (e.g., marketing communications).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Processing necessary to comply with UK law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party companies that help us deliver our services (hosting, payment processing, analytics). All providers are contractually bound to protect your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Organisation:</strong> If you use {companyDetails.tradingName} as part of an organisation, administrators may access your account data.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or to protect our legal rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>We do not sell your personal data to third parties.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>5.1 Google API Services</h3>
      <p>
        {companyDetails.tradingName} integrates with Google Calendar at the user&apos;s request, using OAuth authentication.
        We request the following scopes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>calendar.events:</strong> To create, update, and delete calendar events corresponding to your scheduled jobs and visits within {companyDetails.tradingName}.</li>
        <li><strong>userinfo.email:</strong> To identify the Google account being connected to your {companyDetails.tradingName} profile.</li>
        <li><strong>calendar.freebusy:</strong> To read your free/busy availability (not event details) so {companyDetails.tradingName} can detect scheduling conflicts and avoid double-booking engineers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use this access only to sync your {companyDetails.tradingName} jobs to your Google Calendar. We do not read, store, or use your calendar data for any other purpose beyond this synchronization feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>{companyDetails.tradingName}&apos;s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the{' '}
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-secondary hover:underline">
          Google API Services User Data Policy
        </a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can revoke {companyDetails.tradingName}&apos;s access to your Google Calendar at any time via your{' '}
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-secondary hover:underline">
          Google Account settings
        </a>{' '}
        or by disconnecting the integration within {companyDetails.tradingName} (Settings → Calendar Integration).
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Intuit QuickBooks Online</h3>
      <p>
        {companyDetails.tradingName} integrates with QuickBooks Online at the user&apos;s request, using OAuth 2.0 authentication.
        We request a single scope, <strong>com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting</strong>, to create and update invoices and customer
        records in your connected QuickBooks company and to read back the payment status of those invoices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration is one-way: {companyDetails.tradingName} pushes invoice and customer data to QuickBooks and reads payment
        status; we do not import or store a copy of your wider QuickBooks financial data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We store your OAuth access and refresh tokens (encrypted at rest), your QuickBooks company identifier (realmId), and
        reference IDs linking {companyDetails.tradingName} records to their QuickBooks counterparts. We do not access QuickBooks
        Payments and handle no card data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can revoke {companyDetails.tradingName}&apos;s access at any time by disconnecting within {companyDetails.tradingName}{' '}
        (Settings → Accounting Integration) or from your{' '}
        <a href="https://accounts.intuit.com/app/account-manager/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-secondary hover:underline">
          Intuit account&apos;s connected-apps settings
        </a>.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Anthropic, PBC (AI Features)</h3>
      <p>
        Some {companyDetails.tradingName} features use artificial intelligence to help you set up your workspace
        and answer questions about your own data. When you use them, the relevant information is sent to our
        AI provider, Anthropic, PBC, which processes it and returns a result. Two features do this today:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Setup Copilot</strong> reads files you upload and, if you give us the address, the text of your
          public website, so that it can work out how to map your customer, site and contact records — this can
          include anything contained in those files, such as names, addresses, email addresses and telephone
          numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Insights</strong> answers business questions using figures already held in your account: totals
          and summaries such as revenue, margin, outstanding invoices, open quotes and upcoming work, together
          with the customer or site names those figures relate to. Free-text fields — job notes, descriptions and
          quotation terms — are never sent to Insights.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your information is sent only in order to produce your answer. It is not used to train AI models, it is
        never combined with or made visible to another {companyDetails.tradingName} customer, and the AI cannot
        change anything in your account by itself: it can only propose a change, which someone on your team then
        chooses to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anthropic retains the information it receives for a limited period under its standard API terms, to
        provide and monitor the service. Within {companyDetails.tradingName}, Insights conversations are deleted
        after 30 days and Setup Copilot conversations after 90 days, and every Insights question is recorded in
        your audit log against the user who asked it.
      </p>

      <h3>5.4 Sub-Processors</h3>
      <p>
        The table below lists the sub-processors we use to provide {companyDetails.tradingName}, what they
        process, and the safeguard in place for any transfer of data outside the UK.

        Your data is stored on secure servers located in the <strong>{companyDetails.compliance.dataHostingLocation}</strong>.
        We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption of data in transit (TLS) and at rest, including application-layer encryption of third-party integration credentials</li>
        <li>Logical isolation of each customer&apos;s data within our multi-tenant platform</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to:</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fire logbook records are different.</strong> A Digital Fire Logbook is a legal record that belongs
        to the building. It is kept for as long as the fire safety company uses {companyDetails.tradingName}. If the
        company leaves, we will arrange for the logbook to be handed over, usually to the building&apos;s Responsible Person, before it is
        deleted. See the <Link href="/logbook/privacy">Digital Fire Logbook Privacy Notice</Link>.

        Your data is primarily processed within the United Kingdom. Where we transfer data outside the UK,
