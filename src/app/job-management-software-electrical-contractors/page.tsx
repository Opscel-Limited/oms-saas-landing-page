              British electrical contractors face a big choice today. The electrical services market continues to expand with EV chargers, solar installations, and smart home technology. Many companies struggle with too much paperwork, which is why implementing effective job management software can streamline operations. Hard work on-site should not lead to hours at a desk.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-6">
              A review of the UK trade market shows a gap. Many tools are too complex for a small crew. They feel like they were built for a boardroom, not a van. Opscel fills this gap with simple screens designed for electricians.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-6">
              UK SMEs make up over ninety-nine percent of the business world. Small changes in work speed can add billions to the British economy. Most electrical firms now use cloud tools to handle their daily tasks. A shift to digital work helps teams win more bids and keep clients happy. Opscel job management software offers the right path for these firms.

              Why UK Electrical Contractors Must Go Digital
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The world of electrical work is more complex now. You wire buildings and also set up solar power or EV chargers. Manual notes lead to delays and high costs. Over fifty percent of electrical firms already use digital forms. A lack of clear tools can hurt your growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              Efficiency is the main goal for most owners. Software should feel invisible in the field. It must simply help the team do a good job. Digital tools can boost company growth by eighteen percent over time. The right tool saves time for every staff member.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
              NICEIC and ECA registered contractors need audit trails, retest tracking, and BS 7671 compliance. Opscel handles all of this automatically.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Opscel Section */}

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The industry is changing fast. New tech like EV chargers and smart homes adds complexity. Therefore, you need a tool that stays ahead. Opscel is the first of its kind. It is built for the future.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">

              Key Features for Electrical Contractors
            </h2>

            {/* Telegram Integration */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Telegram Linking</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                Most engineers already use Telegram for chatting. Opscel uses a bot on that same app. No new software needs to be installed on their phones. Account linking takes just a few minutes. Then, job alerts arrive as simple messages.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                The bot handles GPS check-ins in two seconds. Engineers snap photos of consumer units or test equipment. They can dictate notes instead of typing. Voice capture saves a lot of time in the van. All data syncs to the office in real time.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Xero Integration */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Xero Integration</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                Double data entry is a waste of money. Opscel links directly to Xero and QuickBooks. One click posts your invoice to the books. Line items and tax codes move over perfectly. This makes the life of your accountant much easier.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                Payment status updates back to the app automatically. You see what is paid without opening the bank site. It also creates new customers in the accounting tool. No duplicate records will clutter your files. This flow keeps your cash moving fast.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Dashboard */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Unique Dashboard</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                A good dashboard shows you what to do next. Opscel loads your data in under half a second. It uses colour codes to show if staff are too busy. Green means capacity, while red means overloaded. You can assign emergency calls to the right person fast.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                The quote pipeline shows your win rate. You see which deals are stuck in a queue. 4-week sparklines show if jobs are trending up. This helps you see growth without running a report. An activity feed shows work as it happens.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Customer Portal */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Customer Portal</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                Customers want to help themselves. The portal gives them twenty-four-hour access to their docs. They view quotes and pay deposits on their phones. Quote approval happens in thirty seconds instead of days. This professional look builds massive trust.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                Calls to the office drop by forty percent. Clients do not need to ask &ldquo;Where is my certificate?&rdquo;. They download PDFs with one click from a secure link. The system logs when they view the document. You have proof that they received the compliance cert.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                All these make Opscel as the best job management software for electrical contractors in the UK a safe bet for growth.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              Electrical work must follow the BS 7671 rules. This tool knows every rule in the book. It even knows Table 41.4 by heart. It checks your test results for you. No errors. It stops a person from sending a bad certificate.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The system uses an auto-lookup for Zs limits. If an engineer enters a wrong value, the tool flags a warning. Safety first. It applies temperature correction math as well. No more manual lookups. No more calculators.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              Opscel supports all standard electrical certificates: EIC, EICR, Minor Works, and PAT Testing. Each form matches the official BS 7671 model forms perfectly.

              The software prevents the issue of bad certificates. You cannot issue an EICR if a major defect is marked as safe. It blocks mistakes before they happen. This reduces legal risk for the business owner. It builds a clear audit trail for every single job.

              Electrical work requires very deep detail. You must track circuits, test results, and observations. Opscel handles multiple certificate types. Each one follows official model forms. This keeps your NICEIC or ECA status in good standing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The system tracks when a periodic inspection is due. It flags these dates on your dashboard. You will never miss a chance for repeat work. This creates a steady flow of cash for the firm. A clear history shows every installation in just two clicks.

A 30-day free trial (card required, first charge on day 30) lets you test everything first — and every new plan gets 50% off its base price for the first 3 months, no code needed.
