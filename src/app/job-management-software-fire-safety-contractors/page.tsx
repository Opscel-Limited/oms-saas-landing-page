              British fire safety firms face a big choice today. The global fire safety market will grow to eighty-four billion pounds by 2032. Many companies struggle with too much paperwork, which is why implementing effective job management software can streamline operations. Hard work on-site should not lead to hours at a desk.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-6">
              A review of the UK trade market shows a gap. Many tools are too complex for a small crew. They feel like they were built for a boardroom, not a van. Opscel fills this gap with simple screens.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-6">
              UK SMEs make up over ninety-nine percent of the business world. Small changes in work speed can add billions to the British economy. Most fire safety firms now use cloud tools to handle their daily tasks. A shift to digital work helps teams win more bids and keep clients happy. Opscel job management software offers the right path for these firms.

              Why UK Fire Safety Contractors Must Go Digital
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The world of fire safety work is more complex now. You service fire alarms, emergency lighting, extinguishers, and more. Manual notes lead to delays and high costs. Over fifty percent of fire safety firms already use digital forms. A lack of clear tools can hurt your growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              Efficiency is the main goal for most owners. Software should feel invisible in the field. It must simply help the team do a good job. Digital tools can boost company growth by eighteen percent over time. The right tool saves time for every staff member.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
              BAFE-registered contractors need audit trails, retest tracking, and BS 5839 compliance. Opscel handles all of this automatically.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Opscel Section */}

              Opscel: The Best Job Management Software For Fire Safety Contractors
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The industry is changing fast. New regulations and stricter compliance checks add complexity. Therefore, you need a tool that stays ahead. Opscel is the first of its kind. It is built for the future.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">

            </p>

              Key Features for Fire Safety Contractors
            </h2>

            {/* Telegram Integration */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Telegram Linking</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                Most engineers already use Telegram for chatting. Opscel uses a bot on that same app. No new software needs to be installed on their phones. Account linking takes just a few minutes. Then, job alerts arrive as simple messages.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                The bot sends job alerts and check-in reminders. The work itself happens in the Opscel field app: GPS check-in in two seconds, photos of panels or defects, and notes dictated instead of typed. Voice capture saves a lot of time in the van. Everything syncs to the office as soon as the phone has signal.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Xero Integration */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Xero Integration</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                Double data entry is a waste of money. Opscel links directly to Xero and QuickBooks. One click posts your invoice to the books. Line items and tax codes move over perfectly. This makes the life of your accountant much easier.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                Payment status updates back to the app automatically. You see what is paid without opening the bank site. It also creates new customers in the accounting tool. No duplicate records will clutter your files. This flow keeps your cash moving fast.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Dashboard */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Unique Dashboard</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                A good dashboard shows you what to do next. Opscel loads your data in under half a second. It uses colour codes to show if staff are too busy. Green means capacity, while red means overloaded. You can assign emergency calls to the right person fast.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                The quote pipeline shows your win rate. You see which deals are stuck in a queue. 4-week sparklines show if jobs are trending up. This helps you see growth without running a report. An activity feed shows work as it happens.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Customer Portal */}
            <div className="mb-10">
              <h3 className="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4">Customer Portal</h3>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
                Customers want to help themselves. The portal gives them twenty-four-hour access to their docs. They view quotes and pay deposits on their phones. Quote approval happens in thirty seconds instead of days. This professional look builds massive trust.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
                Calls to the office drop by forty percent. Clients do not need to ask &ldquo;Where is my certificate?&rdquo;. They download PDFs with one click from a secure link. The system logs when they view the document. You have proof that they received the compliance cert.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              Fire safety work must follow BS 5839 and other British Standards. This tool knows every rule in the book. It checks your inspection results for you. No errors. It stops a person from sending a bad certificate.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The software has 25 custom fields just for fire safety. It tracks panel types, zone counts, and device locations with ease. Reliable records? Absolutely. It makes audit trails that no one can change.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
              The software checks a fire alarm service cert before it is issued. It will not issue one unless the panel, battery and reset tests are recorded as a pass and the service engineer has signed. If defects are marked as found but no details are written, it warns you before you issue. It catches mistakes before they reach the customer. This reduces legal risk for the business owner. It builds a clear audit trail for every single job.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              Fire safety work requires very deep detail. You must track extinguishers, alarms, emergency lights, and more. Opscel handles eleven types of fire safety certificates — Fire Alarm Service, Commissioning, Modification, Installation, Design, Acceptance, and Verification, plus Emergency Lighting, Extinguisher Service, Cable Test Readings, and EVC Commissioning. Each one follows official model forms. This keeps your BAFE status in good standing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent mb-4">
              The system tracks when a retest is due. It flags these dates on your dashboard. You will never miss a chance for repeat work. This creates a steady flow of cash for the firm. A clear history shows every panel service in just two clicks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground-accent">
              Service contracts automate recurring inspections. The system generates new jobs based on your maintenance schedules. Annual fire alarm services appear automatically. You spend less time on admin and more time on-site.

              The cost of software is often a big worry. Some tools charge a fee for every single job. Opscel uses a flat monthly rate instead, plus £29/month for each extra user on any plan. This helps you plan your budget with ease. A 30-day free trial (card required, first charge on day 30) lets you test everything first — and every new plan gets 50% off its base price for the first 3 months, no code needed.
