            <strong>3.1 Free Trial.</strong> New customers may receive a 30-day free trial period as determined by Opscel in its sole discretion. A valid payment method is required to commence the trial, though Customer is not charged during the trial itself. Unless cancelled by Customer prior to the end of the trial, the Subscription will automatically convert to a paid Subscription and Customer authorises Opscel to charge the applicable Subscription Fees.

            <strong>AI features within the Service are assistive tools only. They are NOT a substitute for professional judgment, qualified engineering assessment, or independent verification. Customer must independently verify all AI-generated outputs before relying on them for any compliance, safety, professional, or regulatory purpose. Opscel disclaims all liability for any decisions made or actions taken in reliance on AI outputs.</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4 text-foreground-accent">
          <p>
            <strong>6.1 AI Features.</strong> The Service includes features that use artificial intelligence, machine learning, large language models, and similar technologies (collectively, &quot;<strong>AI Features</strong>&quot;), including without limitation Setup Copilot (workspace setup assistance), Insights (natural-language answers to business questions about Customer&apos;s account), auto-fill, document classification, defect identification suggestions, scheduling optimisation, predictive analytics, and compliance validation suggestions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.2 AS-IS Provision.</strong> AI Features are provided on an &quot;AS-IS&quot; and &quot;AS-AVAILABLE&quot; basis. Opscel makes no representations or warranties of any kind regarding the accuracy, reliability, completeness, timeliness, or fitness for purpose of any AI-generated content.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.3 Hallucinations and Errors.</strong> Customer acknowledges and accepts that AI Features may produce inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, biased, or fabricated outputs (commonly known as &quot;hallucinations&quot;). Customer is solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and verifying all AI-generated outputs before any reliance, distribution, or action.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.4 Professional Verification Required.</strong> AI outputs relating to electrical or fire safety compliance (including but not limited to Zs values, RCD requirements, certificate validation, defect codes, observation classifications) must be independently verified by a qualified professional against the relevant British Standards. <strong>Failure to independently verify AI outputs is at Customer&apos;s sole risk.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.5 No Liability for AI Outputs.</strong> Without limiting Section 14, Opscel shall have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, claim, fine, penalty, regulatory action, professional sanction, certificate invalidation, safety incident, injury, or any other consequence arising from or related to Customer&apos;s use of, reliance on, or distribution of AI-generated outputs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.6 No Model Training.</strong> Opscel does not use Customer Data to train AI models — not for Customer&apos;s own tenant, not for other customers, and not for general model improvement. Data sent to power an AI Feature is used only to produce the requested output. Conversations with Insights are retained for 30 days and with Setup Copilot for 90 days, after which they are deleted; every Insights query is recorded in Customer&apos;s audit log against the user who made it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.7 Third-Party AI.</strong> AI Features are powered by Anthropic, PBC, acting as Opscel&apos;s sub-processor, and Customer Data sent to power them is never combined with or made visible to another Opscel customer. AI Features do not modify Customer&apos;s account directly — they may propose a change, which a member of Customer&apos;s team must then choose to apply. Full detail on what is sent, to whom, and for how long is set out in section 5.3 of Opscel&apos;s <Link href="/privacy" className="text-secondary hover:underline">Privacy Policy</Link>. Anthropic and any other third-party AI provider is subject to its own terms of service, and Opscel is not liable for the acts, omissions, or outputs of third-party AI providers.
