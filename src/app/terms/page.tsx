        Your use of such services is subject to their respective terms and conditions. We are not responsible

      </p>

      <h2>9A. Digital Fire Logbook</h2>
      <p>
        These terms apply if you use the {companyDetails.tradingName} Digital Fire Logbook. They sit alongside the
        rest of these Terms.
      </p>
      {/* SOLICITOR: review this whole section before it goes live. */}
      <h3>9A.1 People you add</h3>
      <p>
        You need a lawful basis to add people to a logbook, such as the building&apos;s keeper, a backup or the
        Responsible Person. You must keep their details accurate. You must tell them the logbook exists and where
        to find the{' '}
        <Link href="/logbook/privacy" className="text-secondary hover:underline">Digital Fire Logbook Privacy Notice</Link>.
        The invitation email does part of this for you.
      </p>
      <h3>9A.2 A record-keeping tool, not advice</h3>
      <p>
        The logbook is a record-keeping tool. It helps a site keep the records that BS 5839-1 and BS 5266-1 expect.
        It does not certify that a building complies with any standard or law. It is not fire safety advice. The
        fire risk assessment and the Responsible Person&apos;s duties stay with the Responsible Person.
      </p>
      <h3>9A.3 If the logbook or a phone is not available</h3>
      <p>
        Keep testing when the logbook or a phone is unavailable. The sticker kit includes paper record sheets. You
        can add checks later with &quot;I did this earlier&quot;.
      </p>
      <h3>9A.4 Fire door checks</h3>
      <p>
        Fire door checks under the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 are not part of the logbook yet.
      </p>
      {/* SOLICITOR: the fire door sentence above simplifies the 2022 Regulations (they apply to buildings with two
          or more domestic premises, and some checks apply only above 11 m). Confirm the wording. */}

      <h3>9A.5 Requests about people in a logbook</h3>
      <p>
        If someone asks us to remove their details from a logbook, we tell you and act on your instruction. If you do
        not answer within 14 days, or you no longer use {companyDetails.tradingName}, you instruct us to handle the
        request under our erasure policy, as described in the{' '}
        <Link href="/logbook/privacy" className="text-secondary hover:underline">Digital Fire Logbook Privacy Notice</Link>.
      </p>
      {/* OWNER: price deliberately not stated here. Pricing belongs on the pricing page. Billing is not live. Do not
          add a price until the owner confirms it. */}
