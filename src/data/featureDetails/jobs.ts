    faq: [
        {
            question: 'Can I customize job types for my business?',
            answer: 'Opscel includes 6 default job types (Emergency, Planned Maintenance, Reactive Repair, Installation, Testing & Inspection, Commissioning). You can add custom job types and map them to specific certificate templates. This ensures the right PDF generates when the job completes.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How do multi-engineer assignments work?',
            answer: 'Assign multiple engineers to a job and designate one as primary. All assigned engineers see the job on their mobile app. Primary engineer typically handles customer signature and completion. Useful for two-person installations or training new staff.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What are the industry-specific fields?',

        {
            question: 'How does parts tracking work?',
            answer: 'Engineers add parts used from the product catalog (or create custom items) while on-site. Each part has quantity and cost. These auto-populate invoice line items. You see exact material costs per job and true profitability.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Can jobs have multiple visits?',
            answer: 'Yes. Some jobs need multiple visits (install Tuesday, test Thursday, final inspection next week). Each visit tracks GPS check-in/out, photos, notes, and duration separately. Customer sees complete timeline. You see true cost per visit.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What happens when a job is marked complete?',
            answer: 'System triggers certificate auto-generation (if job type requires it), calculates final duration from GPS logs, updates job status, and files all documents (photos, signatures, certificates) to the job folder. Office can immediately create invoice.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Can I turn a recurring job into a service contract?',
            answer: 'Yes. Open any completed job, go to the ⋮ menu, and choose "Convert to contract". Set the cadence (weekly, or monthly-based cycles of 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 or 60 months), lead time, and per-visit price — the customer, site, and engineer carry over automatically. Future visits generate themselves before each due date. See /features/service-contracts for the full recurring contracts feature.'
