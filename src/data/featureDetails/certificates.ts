Auto-lookup Zs limits, validate test results, capture GPS-tagged signatures, and maintain immutable audit trails. Your engineers can\'t accidentally issue a non-compliant certificate.',

    faq: [
        {
            question: 'Does Opscel support BAFE, NICEIC, ECA, and FIA certificate formats?',
            answer: 'Yes. Certificate formats match what your trade body expects — we\'ve mapped the mandatory fields from each standard so you don\'t have to cross-reference the spec. BAFE SP203-1 fire alarm certificates include the required BAFE reference and scheme fields. NICEIC electrical certificates follow the approved contractor format with enrolment number. ECA and FIA members get the same standards-compliant outputs their membership requires. Every certificate type auto-selects the right template based on the work you\'re signing off, so you never issue the wrong format to the wrong body.'
        },

            question: 'How does BS 7671 Zs auto-lookup work?',
            answer: 'When you enter a Zs reading for a circuit, Opscel automatically looks up the maximum permitted value from BS 7671 Table 41.4 based on protective device type (MCB/RCBO/Fuse) and rating (6A, 10A, 16A, etc.). It then applies temperature correction factor (×0.8 for 70°C conductors) and shows pass/fail status with margin. Example: B32 MCB has 1.44Ω limit, corrected to 1.152Ω. Your reading of 1.2Ω shows ⚠️ WARNING (compliant but close). No manual table lookups or calculator needed.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What prevents engineers from issuing non-compliant certificates?',
            answer: 'System enforces regulations before allowing issue. Can\'t issue EIC with IR <1MΩ (BS 7671 minimum). The EICR outcome is worked out from the observation codes: any C1 or C2 makes it Unsatisfactory. Can\'t issue Solar PV with Voc/Isc >10% deviation from expected. Can\'t skip required signatures (BS 7671 needs Designer, Constructor, Inspector). Engineers can\'t bypass validation—system blocks non-compliant issue.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What forensic evidence is captured with digital signatures?',
            answer: 'Every signature captures: GPS coordinates (proves engineer was on-site), IP address (network evidence), exact timestamp (when signed), device info (which phone/tablet), signature image (visual confirmation). For BS 7671 certificates requiring 3 signatures (Designer, Constructor, Inspector), each party\'s signature captures all this data. In disputes or insurance claims, you have complete proof of who signed what, where they were, and when it happened.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Can customers claim they never received a certificate?',
            answer: 'No. Customer portal tracks digital acknowledgment with timestamps. You send secure link (no login needed), customer views certificate, downloads PDF, and digitally acknowledges receipt. System stores: date/time they viewed certificate, date/time they acknowledged, IP address, device used. You have complete proof of delivery. If customer claims "never received", you show them viewing timestamp and acknowledgment record.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How does remediation tracking work for EICRs?',
            answer: 'EICR inspection finds a C2 (e.g., faulty RCD). Record it as an observation on the EICR with its location and remedial action. The EICR can\'t be issued as "Satisfactory" with C1/C2 present. From the observation, the office clicks Create Quote to open a remedial quote pre-filled with the observation details, and once saved the observation shows as Quoted. Customer accepts, the quote converts to a job for the remedial work, and the engineer issues a Minor Works certificate for it. Mark the observation remediated when the work is done. Quotes are never raised automatically - the office stays in control of what goes to the customer. Job defects (Observation, Minor, Major, Critical) are a separate record from EICR observation codes; see the Defects feature for how those turn into remedial quotes.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What happens if I need to void a certificate?',
            answer: 'Voiding requires written reason (stored permanently in database). Original certificate retained with clear "VOIDED" status—can\'t delete, only void. If you issue superseding certificate, system creates linked chain showing original → voided → replacement. Complete chain of custody for audits. Status history tracks who voided it, when, why, from which IP/device. Maintains compliance with record-keeping requirements while preventing voided certificate from being used.'
