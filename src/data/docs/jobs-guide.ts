                        Jobs are the core work units in Opscel. They represent scheduled work at a customer site—from routine servicing to
                        emergency callouts. Jobs can have single or multiple visits, track time and materials, generate certificates and invoices,
                        and integrate with your calendar.

                            A <strong>job</strong> is the overall work order. A <strong>visit</strong> is a scheduled date/time for an engineer to go on-site.
                            Single-visit jobs have one visit. Multi-visit jobs have multiple visits (e.g., Day 1: inspection, Day 2: repair).
                            Each visit can have different engineers, times, and work summaries.

                            A cron job runs daily at 05:00 UTC (UK-aligned). It checks all active service contracts and creates jobs for any contracts

                            Yes. When scheduling a visit, select multiple engineers. They all see the job in their field app. Each checks in/out
                            independently. Photos, defects, and parts are shared. Work summary is collaborative—any engineer can edit it until the
