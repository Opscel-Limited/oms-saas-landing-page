                        This is your day-one checklist. It walks you through the essential setup steps in the right order so you can start
                        using Opscel immediately without getting lost in settings. Think of it as the fastest path from "empty account" to "first job booked."

                    Opscel also offers a newer, AI-assisted way to work through onboarding: the <strong>Setup Copilot</strong>, a chat
                    interface (gated to Admin/Super Admin) that can read a spreadsheet, PDF, scanned document, or your company
                    website and propose setup changes from it — filling in your company profile, matching accreditation bodies,
                    importing a workbook of customers or products, or drafting terms.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    It never writes to your account directly. Every proposal is a suggestion you review and approve — applying one
                    runs through the exact same permission-gated setup screens you'd use by hand, so nothing happens that you
                    couldn't have done yourself.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    It's a newer capability, scoped specifically to onboarding conversations rather than general account changes,
                    reachable from the nav and from a dashboard setup card. Ask support if you'd like a hand trying it during
                    setup.
