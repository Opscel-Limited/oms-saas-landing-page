Tap <strong>✓ Serviced as listed</strong> on a row that's correct as-is — it switches to <strong>Confirmed</strong>, with an <strong>Undo</strong> if you tap it by mistake — or edit the row to record what you actually did. When several rows still need confirming, <strong>Mark remaining N as serviced</strong> confirms the rest of the section in one go (two taps, to be sure). Add a row only for equipment that isn't listed. If something listed genuinely isn't there any more, mark it <strong>Missing / Not Found</strong> rather than deleting the row — a deleted row just goes unrecorded, while Missing / Not Found tells the office and never counts as a service.
