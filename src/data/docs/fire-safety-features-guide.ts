                        Opscel brings BS 5839-1:2025 servicing records and BAFE SP203 scheme documentation together in a single jobsheet
                        that engineers fill on site. Faults logged at a site carry forward across visits automatically, so engineers
                        see the complete fault history — weeks, months, or years later — without digging through old job records.
