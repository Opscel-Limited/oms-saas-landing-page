                    Opscel is built around a single end-to-end workflow: <strong>Quote → Job → Invoice</strong>. Here's exactly how the three fit together.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Understanding this workflow is essential because the system treats quote-originated jobs differently from standalone jobs when creating invoices. A £10k accepted quote becomes a £10k invoice—the system respects the contract price, not just the parts and labour actuals.
