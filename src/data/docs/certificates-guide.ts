                        PDFs match official BS 7671 and industry model forms. Certificates are issued with unique numbers, filed automatically,
                        and delivered to customers via secure portal.

                            No. Once issued, certificates become read-only for compliance. If you need to correct an error, you must void the original and issue a new certificate. Use supersede if you want to link the new certificate to the old one for audit trail.
