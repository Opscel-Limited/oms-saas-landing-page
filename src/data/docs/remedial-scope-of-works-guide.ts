                    Engineers find things that need fixing on almost every visit. When an engineer logs a defect that is <strong>Major</strong> or <strong>Critical</strong>, or ticks <strong>"Quote required for remedial work"</strong>, a draft <strong>Remedial Scope of Works</strong> sheet attaches itself to the job. Its <strong>Defects in Scope</strong> list is a live view of the job's defects, so it keeps up on its own as defects are logged, edited or removed. The engineer adds a short "Details of works required" summary and marks the sheet complete; the office then turns it into one bundled quote, with parts and labour already priced from each defect.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The sheet is an <strong>internal, office-only document</strong>. The customer never sees or signs it - they see and accept the priced quote it produces.
